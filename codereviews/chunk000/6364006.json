{"description":"Fix StatsCounters on mac.\r\n\r\nIn order for the shared memory to work, they must all use the same file name\r\nwhich is keyed by the pid of the browser process. Previously the mac code path\r\nwas using the pid for each process so there was no sharing happening. Now mac\r\nuses the same code path as win which properly uses the parent pid for all procs.\r\n\r\nBUG=None\r\nTEST=None\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=72538","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["mbelshe@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"tonyg@chromium.org","recipients":["tonyg@chromium.org","mbelshe@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"http://codereview.chromium.org/6364006/diff/1/chrome/app/chrome_main.cc\nFile chrome/app/chrome_main.cc (left):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/6364006/diff/1/chrome/app/chrome_main.cc#oldcode768\nchrome/app/chrome_main.cc:768: #if defined(OS_MACOSX)\nFYI, this is no functional change.
