That use is the creation of tab thumbnails.  I took a look at that code, and it does handle failures of CopyFromBackingStore() gracefully.  So, I changed CopyFromBackingStore() as you recommend.\n","draft":false,"lineno":348,"date":"2010-03-12 17:06:39.269812","left":false}],"id":1009,"is_binary":false},"chrome/browser/renderer_host/backing_store.cc":{"status":"M","num_chunks":1,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":4,"num_removed":0,"messages":[],"id":1007,"is_binary":false},"chrome/browser/renderer_host/backing_store.h":{"status":"M","num_chunks":1,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":4,"num_removed":0,"messages":[],"id":1008,"is_binary":false},"chrome/browser/extensions/extension_tabs_module.cc":{"status":"M","num_chunks":1,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":1,"num_removed":1,"messages":[],"id":1006,"is_binary":false},"chrome/browser/renderer_host/backing_store_x.h":{"status":"M","num_chunks":1,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":3,"num_removed":0,"messages":[{"author":"brettw","author_email":"brettw@chromium.org","text":"Don't put blank lines around this (for derived classes we put all the functions together under one commend listing the source of the override).","draft":false,"lineno":60,"date":"2010-03-11 19:40:01.780345","left":false}],"id":1010,"is_binary":false}},"owner_email":"skerner@chromium.org","owner":"Sam Kerner (Chrome)","message":"Rebase.","try_job_results":[{"parent_name":null,"tests":[],"slave":null,"url":"http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-server/buildstatus?builder=win&number=22222","timestamp":"2010-03-12 17:06:39.340796","builder":"win","clobber":null,"project":null,"reason":null,"result":"2","key":"ahdzfmNocm9taXVtY29kZXJldmlldy1ocnIvCxIFSXNzdWUYsdQyDAsSCFBhdGNoU2V0GNEPDAsSDFRyeUpvYlJlc3VsdBicdQw","requester":null,"buildnumber":null,"revision":null},{"parent_name":null,"tests":[],"slave":null,"url":"http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-server/buildstatus?builder=mac&number=21218","timestamp":"2010-03-12 17:06:39.340796","builder":"mac","clobber":null,"project":null,"reason":null,"result":"0","key":"ahdzfmNocm9taXVtY29kZXJldmlldy1ocnIvCxIFSXNzdWUYsdQyDAsSCFBhdGNoU2V0GNEPDAsSDFRyeUpvYlJlc3VsdBiddQw","requester":null,"buildnumber":null,"revision":null},{"parent_name":null,"tests":[],"slave":null,"url":"http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-server/buildstatus?builder=linux&number=21253","timestamp":"2010-03-12 17:06:39.340796","builder":"linux","clobber":null,"project":null,"reason":null,"result":"0","key":"ahdzfmNocm9taXVtY29kZXJldmlldy1ocnIvCxIFSXNzdWUYsdQyDAsSCFBhdGNoU2V0GNEPDAsSDFRyeUpvYlJlc3VsdBiedQw","requester":null,"buildnumber":null,"revision":null}],"created":"2010-03-10 19:29:21.868751","url":null,"num_comments":3,"modified":"2012-01-13 14:29:20.739753","patchset":2001,"issue":830001}
