{"description":"Browser Plugin: Simplified Embedder Focus state tracking\n\nBrowserPlugin should be grabbing the embedder's focus state straight from the render_view if it exists instead of caching the focus state in a member variable. This simplifies code a bit and is a prerequisite to the new way of allocating instance IDs and initializing state coming in a subsequent patch.\n\nBUG=140316\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=177300","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["creis@chromium.org","lazyboy@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"fsamuel@chromium.org","recipients":["fsamuel@chromium.org","creis@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-16 20:59:37.399420","approval":false},{"sender":"fsamuel@chromium.org","recipients":["fsamuel@chromium.org","creis@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-16 20:59:37.709910","approval":false},{"sender":"fsamuel@chromium.org","recipients":["fsamuel@chromium.org","creis@chromium.org","lazyboy@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"Istiaque: Overall review.\nCharlie: render_view_impl.cc","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-16 21:02:33.223590","approval":false},{"sender":"lazyboy@chromium.org","recipients":["fsamuel@chromium.org","creis@chromium.org","lazyboy@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-16 22:14:45.255990","approval":true},{"sender":"creis@chromium.org","recipients":["fsamuel@chromium.org","creis@chromium.org","lazyboy@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"LGTM.
