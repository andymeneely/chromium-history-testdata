{"description":"Make DesktopRootWindowHostWin::GetBounds use client or window rect to match the logic in HWNDMessageHandler::ClientAreaSizeChanged(). Otherwise, Compositor::SetScaleAndSize gets set initially with the browser frame's size that's off by 1 pixel vertically. It never gets updated because the window_pos flag passed to HWNDMessageHandler::OnWindowPosChanged never reflects a client rect change.\n\nNote this only shows up if glass isn't used. For glass, we need another fix in window_snapshot_aura.cc because then the compositor's size is smaller than the window bounds.\n\nThis fixes PolicyTest.DisableScreenshotsFeedback on win aura.\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=168290","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["ben@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"jam@chromium.org","recipients":["jam@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-16 01:15:21.516040","approval":false},{"sender":"ben@chromium.org","recipients":["jam@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-16 16:28:19.088120","approval":true},{"sender":"jam@chromium.org","recipients":["jam@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"updated with a fix for when using glass (patchset 4)","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-16 17:38:50.400110","approval":false},{"sender":"ben@chromium.org","recipients":["jam@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-16 17:39:15.991710","approval":true}],"owner_email":"jam@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://chrome-svn/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"jam","subject":"Make DesktopRootWindowHostWin::GetBounds return the outer rect of the window, not just the client râ€¦","created":"2012-11-15 21:57:57.371200","patchsets":[1,5001,9001,11002],"modified":"2012-11-16 21:07:37.996930","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":11411017}
