{"description":"Fix opening Google Doc's documents in Files.app V2.\r\n\r\nOpening such files failed, when no browser window was running. This is because packaged apps are not running within a browser window, and therefore GetCurrentBrowser returns NULL, if there is no browser window running. Therefore we need to create a browser instance. This patch fixes this problem by replacing GetCurrentBrowser with a FindOrCreateTabbedBrowser call.\r\n\r\nTEST=Run chrome with --file-manager-packaged, launch Files.app and try to open a .gdoc file.\r\nBUG=231190\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=194287","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nkostylev+watch@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","rginda+watch@chromium.org","oshima+watch@chromium.org","chromium-apps-reviews@chromium.org","stevenjb+watch@chromium.org","davemoore+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["hashimoto@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"mtomasz@chromium.org","recipients":["mtomasz@chromium.org","hashimoto@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nkostylev+watch@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","rginda+watch@chromium.org","oshima+watch@chromium.org","chromium-apps-reviews@chromium.org","stevenjb+watch@chromium.org","davemoore+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"@hashimoto: PTAL, thanks.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-04-15 06:53:56.913080","approval":false},{"sender":"hashimoto@chromium.org","recipients":["mtomasz@chromium.org","hashimoto@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nkostylev+watch@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","rginda+watch@chromium.org","oshima+watch@chromium.org","chromium-apps-reviews@chromium.org","stevenjb+watch@chromium.org","davemoore+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-04-15 06:57:22.357950","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["mtomasz@chromium.org","hashimoto@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nkostylev+watch@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","rginda+watch@chromium.org","oshima+watch@chromium.org","chromium-apps-reviews@chromium.org","stevenjb+watch@chromium.org","davemoore+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
