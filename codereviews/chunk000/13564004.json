{"description":"Complete update of zlib from 1.2.3 to 1.2.5.\n\nYou may think that https://codereview.chromium.org/8806004 , back in\n2011, did this. However, that's not correct. That update only patched files which\nwere present in both our old, customized checkout and zlib 1.2.5.\n\nIn zlib 1.2.5, gzio.c was replaced with gzclose.c, gzguts.h, gzlib.c, gzread.c\nand gzwrite.c. We did not add those files. We just used the gzio.c from 1.2.3\nwith our custom patches from Gears, together with the rest of 1.2.5.\n\nThis unholy chimera worked until I went ahead and tried to fix the broken\nmangling for 64 bit API symbols. See\nhttps://codereview.chromium.org/13473020/ . This uncovered the lack of\ngzread64, which was, after that fix, referenced by libxml. Since gzio.c from\n1.2.3 doesn't have gzread64, this was something of a problem. I'm thus\nfinishing the update.\n\nR=agl@chromium.org,rsleevi@chromium.org,brettw@chromium.org,bradchen@chromium.org\nBUG=None\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=193127","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["agl@chromium.org","rsleevi@chromium.org","brettw@chromium.org","bradchen@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"gavinp@chromium.org","recipients":["gavinp@chromium.org","agl@chromium.org","rsleevi@chromium.org","brettw@chromium.org","bradchen@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"Folks,\n\nPlease take a look.

I was worried because LoadComponentExtensionResource was getting hit a lot. It seems to be flakey.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-04-09 14:43:46.012880","approval":false},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["gavinp@chromium.org","agl@chromium.org","rsleevi@chromium.org","brettw@chromium.org","bradchen@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
