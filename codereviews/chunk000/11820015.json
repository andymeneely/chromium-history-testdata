See\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=168725\n\nWe'll probably chose a different strategy to fix this in a better way (in\nterms of how the code should work), but at least this puts the behavior\nback to what people are used to.\n\nBUG=168725\nTBR=mpearson@chromium.org\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=175668","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","suzhe@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["mpearson@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"mpearson@chromium.org","recipients":["mpearson@chromium.org","mpearson@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","suzhe@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-09 02:01:20.093540","approval":false}],"owner_email":"mpearson@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"Mark P","subject":"Revert 175099","created":"2013-01-09 02:01:17.821830","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2013-01-09 02:01:28.979080","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":11820015}
