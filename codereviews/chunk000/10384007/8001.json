This will result in the icons not being evenly spaced from each other.  It seems like it'd be better to either always center the icon within the entire view, or else always place it on the \"first line\", and if there's only one line of text, place that on the \"first line\" as well instead of centering it vertically.  Either of these will result in evenly spaced icons and look better IMO.","draft":false,"lineno":95,"date":"2012-05-07 21:03:12.602512","left":false},{"author":"Peter Kasting","author_email":"pkasting@chromium.org","text":"Nit: I think it would be slightly better to iterate over all children, and draw lines (conditionally) at the top and bottom of the current view instead of at the (top - 1) and top of the current view.\n\nWhile this means we'd need to add conditionals to check for being on the first and last views, it would also make it more natural to say \"don't paint either line if we're hovered/selected\".
