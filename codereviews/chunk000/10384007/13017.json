The reason I sometimes need to draw both top and bottom of the current child (and skip the top of the following child) is to get that precedence order, and to draw the divider on top of the right background color to blend with (if I draw it on the next child it will be blended with that child's background color, which won't look right).","draft":false,"lineno":87,"date":"2012-05-11 23:09:24.516340","left":false},{"author":"J\u00f3i","author_email":"joi@chromium.org","text":"On 2012/05/11 23:01:41, Peter Kasting wrote:\n> Uff da.\n> \n> Can we just do normal-colored dividers between each row regardless of selection\n> state?
