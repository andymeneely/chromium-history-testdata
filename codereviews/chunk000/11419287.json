{"description":"android: Improve ActivityStatus and add ChromiumActivity.\n\nThe ActivityStatus class used to track activity state changes is too basic\nfor some usage scenarios.\n\nThis patch does the following:\n\n- Augment ActivityStatus with a new StateListener type that can be\n  registered to listen to all activity state changes.\n\n  Also add getActivity(), getState(), registerStateListener()\n  and unregisterStateListener() as static method.\n\n- Add a new ChromiumActivity class that all Chromium main activities\n  should sub-class, to ensure that the ActivityStatus state is updated\n  appropriately.\n\n- Modify all main activities in the Chromium code base to extend\n  from ChromiumActivity instead of Activity.\n\nBUG=none\n\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=171789","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","cbentzel+watch@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","klundberg+watch@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yfriedman+watch@chromium.org","bulach+watch@chromium.org","peter+watch@chromium.org","erikwright+watch@chromium.org","ilevy+watch@chromium.org","jochen+watch@chromium.org","frankf+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["joth@chromium.org","bulach@chromium.org","torne@chromium.org","pliard@chromium.org","yfriedman@chromium.org","jknotten@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"digit@chromium.org","recipients":["digit@chromium.org","joth@chromium.org","bulach@chromium.org","torne@chromium.org","pliard@chromium.org","yfriedman@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","cbentzel+watch@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","klundberg+watch@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yfriedman+watch@chromium.org","bulach+watch@chromium.org","peter+watch@chromium.org","erikwright+watch@chromium.org","ilevy+watch@chromium.org","jochen+watch@chromium.org","frankf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"ping","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-12-04 15:36:07.578040","approval":false},{"sender":"digit@chromium.org","recipients":["digit@chromium.org","joth@chromium.org","bulach@chromium.org","torne@chromium.org","pliard@chromium.org","yfriedman@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","cbentzel+watch@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","klundberg+watch@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yfriedman+watch@chromium.org","bulach+watch@chromium.org","peter+watch@chromium.org","erikwright+watch@chromium.org","ilevy+watch@chromium.org","jochen+watch@chromium.org","frankf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/11419287/diff/1/base/android/java/src/org/chromium/base/ActivityStatus.java\nFile base/android/java/src/org/chromium/base/ActivityStatus.java (right):\n\nhttps://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/11419287/diff/1/base/android/java/src/org/chromium/base/ActivityStatus.java#newcode76\nbase/android/java/src/org/chromium/base/ActivityStatus.java:76: public void onActivityStatusChanged(boolean isPaused);\nNote that I'm pretty sure that the Android convention is to avoid the past tense here, i.e. this should be called \"onActivityStatusChange\" instead.
