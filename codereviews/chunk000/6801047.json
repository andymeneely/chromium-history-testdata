{"description":"GTTF: Fix a few cases of very likely broken code between fork() and exec()\n\nI took another look at http://crbug.com/60426, and decided to also\nreview the LaunchApp code in process_util. It turns out that\nthe child code after fork() contained things like \"return false\",\nrather not what was intended (I replaced it with _exit(127)).\n\nThere are some other cases where we possibly retained some\nsignal handlers. The new code also resets them to defaults.\n\nI don't expect it to fix the referenced bug, but those\n\"obvious\" problems can only make it worse.\n\nBUG=60426\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=80927","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org","brettw-cc@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["agl@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"phajdan.jr@chromium.org","recipients":["phajdan.jr@chromium.org","agl@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org","brettw-cc@chromium.org"],"text":"Changes where some of those problems were introduced:\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/6611007\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/3423012","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-04-07 14:42:27.139960","approval":false},{"sender":"agl@chromium.org","recipients":["phajdan.jr@chromium.org","agl@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org","brettw-cc@chromium.org"],"text":"LGTM","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-04-08 13:40:44.005251","approval":true}],"owner_email":"phajdan.jr@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"Pawe≈Ç Hajdan Jr.","subject":"GTTF: Fix a few cases of very likely broken code between fork() and exec()","created":"2011-04-07 14:41:21.372985","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-05-24 13:20:16.913124","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":6801047}
