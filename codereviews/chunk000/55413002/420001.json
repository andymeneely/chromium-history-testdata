I don't really know why we have that -- it's not particularly shorter, less complicated, or more efficient than using count().  We should probably just remove that.\n\nThe only advantage I could see would be if this supports more containers than expose count(), and thus makes code a bit more \"type-agnostic\" in case the container type is changed later.","draft":false,"lineno":162,"date":"2013-11-05
