{"description":"Unify the version string to be displayed on \"About Chromium\" dialog. (1/6)\r\n\r\nWe decided to split the changes of issue 7104106 (http://codereview.chromium.org/7104106/) into the following steps. This is the first step of them:\r\n\r\n(1) Add CreateVersionString() to chrome_version_info.*, update the GTK+ code to use it. (reviewer: erg, tony)\r\n(2) Update the mac code to use CreateVersionString(). Update About.xib. (reviewer: mark)\r\n(3) Update the views code to use CreateVersionString(). This can happen at the same time as (2). (reviewer: davemoore, tony)\r\n(4) Update version.bat to use lastchange.py. (reviewer: evan)\r\n(5) Update tweak_info_plist to use lastchange.py. This can happen at the same time as (4). (reviewer: mark)\r\n(6) Make changes to lastchange.py and webkit_version.py. (reviewer: evan)\r\n\r\nBUG=37186\r\nTEST=Observe that \"About Chromium\" dialog shows the version string like \"14.0.787.0 (Developer Build 88242 Linux)\" on Linux.
