{"description":"Add flag to Java -> JavaScript to disable exposing inherited methods.\n\nAdd a flag that allows Java Object injection into JavaScript to specify whether\nor not only publicly declared methods of the specified class can be injected or\nwhether all public methods of a class should be injected (the current default).\nThis allows the specific APIs to only inject the few methods that should\nbe injected and not unknowingly expose any other methods (those include\ngetClass, getField, getMethod, getAnnotation, etc.. anything from Object or other\nsuper classes).  In addition, this flag is passed down to other Java Object\ninjections that happen as the result of Objects being returned from method calls.\n\nBUG=\nTEST=\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=147281","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["steveblock@chromium.org","tedchoc@chromium.org","joth@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"dtrainor@chromium.org","recipients":["dtrainor@chromium.org","steveblock@chromium.org","tedchoc@chromium.org","joth@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-07-17 23:44:09.487580","approval":false},{"sender":"steveblock@chromium.org","recipients":["dtrainor@chromium.org","steveblock@chromium.org","tedchoc@chromium.org","joth@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm\n\nShould probably remove the commit message about ContentView, as it's rather confusing at this point.","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-07-18 09:30:38.393910","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["dtrainor@chromium.org","steveblock@chromium.org","tedchoc@chromium.org","joth@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"No LGTM from a valid reviewer yet.
