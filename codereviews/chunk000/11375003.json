{"description":"Make 0 call sequence numbers be invalid.\n\nThis was part of a previous change I abandoned but this part still seems like\na good idea, since if you store sequence numbers for some reason, it's\nimpossible to store one indicating you haven't made a request.\n\nI also worked to define the wraparound behavior since from a recent\nChromium-dev thread, I learned that signed overflow is not defined in C++. My\nprevious patch did this by using unsigned sequence numbers, but this is\ndiscouraged by the style guide and is kind of difficult to change at this point\nanyway.\n\nBUG=\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=166776","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["raymes@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"brettw@chromium.org","recipients":["brettw@chromium.org","raymes@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-08 20:15:58.039960","approval":false},{"sender":"raymes@chromium.org","recipients":["brettw@chromium.org","raymes@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-08 20:28:33.798000","approval":true}],"owner_email":"brettw@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src","owner":"brettw","subject":"Make 0 call sequence numbers be invalid.","created":"2012-11-08 20:14:10.547030","patchsets":[1,2001,10002],"modified":"2012-11-08 22:13:46.005190","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":11375003}
