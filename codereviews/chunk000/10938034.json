{"description":"Eliminate box reordering in media::mp4::BoxReader.\n\nScanChildren() will reorder boxes based on their box type. The\nSampleDescription box is the only supported box which is agnostic about\nthe box type of its children, and it is sensitive to the child order.\nThis patch modifies ReadAllChildren() to read children in order without\nfirst invoking ScanChildren().\n\nR=acolwell\nBUG=\nTEST=BoxReaderTest.ReadAllChildrenTest\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=158046","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","feature-media-reviews@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["acolwell@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"acolwell@chromium.org","recipients":["strobe@google.com","acolwell@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","feature-media-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"LGTM","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-09-21 16:41:03.442780","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["strobe@google.com","acolwell@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","feature-media-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
