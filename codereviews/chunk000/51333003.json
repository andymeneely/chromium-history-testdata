{"description":"Disable thread under DRT content_shell unless explicitly enabled\n\nWe happen to not enable threaded compositing when running\nlayout tests by virtue of the fact that it is enabled by a Finch\nexperiment which is only initialized in chrome.\n\nWhen getting rid of this Finch experiment, a bunch of layout\ntests blew up because that had the effect of enabling threaded\ncompositing on the tests. This makes it so that won't happen.\n\nBUG=302738, 233830, 306557\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=231802","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","jochen+watch@chromium.org","gab@chromium.org","danakj@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["piman@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"ccameron@chromium.org","recipients":["ccameron@chromium.org","piman@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","jochen+watch@chromium.org","gab@chromium.org"],"text":"The aforementioned \"blowing up lyaout tests\" is at\nhttps://codereview.chromium.org/26389003/","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-10-29 21:47:51.567670","approval":false},{"sender":"piman@chromium.org","recipients":["ccameron@chromium.org","piman@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","jochen+watch@chromium.org","gab@chromium.org"],"text":"LGTM to unblock, but can we file a bug to re-enable the thread on layout tests?
