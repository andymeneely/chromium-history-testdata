{"description":"Measure the sync wizard dialog in appropriate units:\nspecifically, units proportional to the fonts used inside of it.\n\nWe approximate the font chosen by the wizard's CSS.

We just use the default\nsans serif font; arial is the default value for that property.\n\nThis fixes an issue where changing to the \"Windows Classic\" theme\non Vista would cause the dialog to be resized, clipping its\ncontents, which are unaffected by the UI font size.\n\nUpdate the default GRIT sizes to closely match the old ones.\n\nOld vs new:\nhttp://www.corp.google.com/~ncarter/wizard-size-screenshots.png\n\nBUG=21828\nTEST=verified old size against new size in Aero Theme with default\nsettings; verified size stays the same under Classic theme.\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=28465","cc":["chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"reviewers":["tim@chromium.org","nickbaum@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"nick@chromium.org","recipients":["nick@chromium.org","tim@chromium.org","nickbaum@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-10-07 23:17:16.892724","approval":false},{"sender":"tim@chromium.org","recipients":["nick@chromium.org","tim@chromium.org","nickbaum@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"LGTM\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/261017/diff/2001/3001\nFile chrome/app/resources/locale_settings.grd (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/261017/diff/2001/3001#newcode655\nLine 655: 30\nmaybe we should update the xtb files too?
