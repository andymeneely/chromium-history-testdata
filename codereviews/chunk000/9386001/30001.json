Better to set up some native handlers, then jump in to JS to do the rest of the job than to have C++ require various JS files, which is a C++/JS dance anyway.\n\nBesides, this may not always be so trivial. Right now all this file does is require() a bunch of modules that perform work as a side-effect, but ideally modules don't perform any work when they are require()d and it would be the responsibility of this file to invoke the schema generation explicitly, which would be much harder to do in C++ than in JS.","draft":false,"lineno":11,"date":"2012-03-02 01:13:58.485326","left":false},{"author":"koz","author_email":"koz@chromium.org","text":"On 2012/03/01 07:24:26, Aaron Boodman wrote:\n> Have schema_generated_bindings just require this?\n\nDone.","draft":false,"lineno":15,"date":"2012-03-02 01:13:58.485599","left":false},{"author":"koz","author_email":"koz@chromium.org","text":"On 2012/03/01 07:24:26, Aaron Boodman wrote:\n> Have miscellaneous_bindings and schema_generated_bindings each require this?\n\nDone.","draft":false,"lineno":16,"date":"2012-03-02 01:13:58.485844","left":false},{"author":"koz","author_email":"koz@chromium.org","text":"On 2012/03/01 07:24:26, Aaron Boodman wrote:\n> I wonder if this could be part of SchemaGeneratedBindings.

Right now setup_bindings.js mirrors what happens with the current v8::Extension based thing: load some modules which set things in chromeHidden, then for each custom binding we check if we can inject that too, then we dispatch an onLoad() event from C++ to have the generation actually occur.\n\nRight now there's no need to set things up as listeners on onLoad() as all this code can be run synchronously, but I think that would be better as its own isolated change.","draft":false,"lineno":22,"date":"2012-03-02 01:13:58.486006","left":false}],"id":31074,"is_binary":false},"chrome/renderer/resources/extensions/json_schema.js":{"status":"M","num_chunks":1,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":1,"num_removed":2,"messages":[],"id":31067,"is_binary":false},"chrome/renderer/extensions/extension_dispatcher.cc":{"status":"M","num_chunks":9,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":235,"num_removed":67,"messages":[{"author":"Aaron Boodman","author_email":"aa@chromium.org","text":"Dead code?","draft":false,"lineno":320,"date":"2012-03-01 07:24:26.107252","left":false},{"author":"Aaron Boodman","author_email":"aa@chromium.org","text":"Dead code.","draft":false,"lineno":324,"date":"2012-03-01 07:24:26.107576","left":false},{"author":"Aaron Boodman","author_email":"aa@chromium.org","text":"Global definitions in a cc file should be in an anonymous namespace at top of file.","draft":false,"lineno":334,"date":"2012-03-01 07:24:26.107880","left":false},{"author":"Aaron Boodman","author_email":"aa@chromium.org","text":"Make this a scoped_ptr, and use module_system.Pass() below.
