I think it's okay to have these variables just appear in scope here - almost all JS environments execute JS in a context where extra variables are available (eg: JS on the web, JS in extensions, node) and they wouldn't be improved by requiring developers to enumerate those variables as parameters in an anonymous function.","draft":false,"lineno":7,"date":"2012-02-27 01:06:14.946106","left":false},{"author":"Aaron Boodman","author_email":"aa@chromium.org","text":"On 2012/02/27 01:06:14, koz wrote:\n> On 2012/02/16 01:54:42, Aaron Boodman wrote:\n> > I'm still not crazy about the magical names.
