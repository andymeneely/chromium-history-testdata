{"description":"Distinguish between different types of failures in the JSON\noutput of run_webkit_tests. This is so the dashboards\ncan match test_expectations.txt semantics. Eventually,\nwe can use this data to replace all the FAIL expectations\nwith TEXT/IMAGE/IMAGE+TEXT as appropriate.\n\nAdd a TODO to run_webkit_tests to get statistics right\nnow that we have IMAGE+TEXT expectations.\n\nTreat simplified diff failures as TEXT failures for the JSON\noutput since noone seems to care about tracking it anymore.\nWe really should just stop spitting out simplified diffs at all.","cc":["chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com","darin@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["dpranke@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"ojan@chromium.org","recipients":["ojan@chromium.org","dpranke@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com","darin@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-10-05 23:40:23.527885","approval":false},{"sender":"dpranke@chromium.org","recipients":["ojan@chromium.org","dpranke@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com","darin@chromium.org","pam+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"One minor nit, otherwise looks good to me.\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/251096/diff/1001/1002\nFile webkit/tools/layout_tests/layout_package/json_results_generator.py (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/251096/diff/1001/1002#newcode396\nLine 396: return \"O\"\nSeems like \"O\" should never happen, and so maybe this should throw an exception rather than returning an unknown value?
