{"description":"Revert 194394 \"Move swapcomplete callback into OutputSurface\"\n\nIt broke android in a weird manner, like it shows in your trybots.\n\n> Move swapcomplete callback into OutputSurface\n> \n> Things like swap are concepts of an OutputSurface, not a context. Moving the\n> callbacks to OutputSurface will also reduce cc's knowledge of the context\n> guts and let us swap out the GL interface.\n> \n> Review URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/12545018\n\nTBR=jamesr@chromium.org\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=194459","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["jamesr@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"cpu@chromium.org","recipients":["cpu@chromium.org","jamesr@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-04-16 22:05:53.508230","approval":false},{"sender":"cpu@chromium.org","recipients":["cpu@chromium.org","jamesr@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"Committed patchset #1 manually as r194459.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-04-16 22:06:57.480730","approval":false}],"owner_email":"cpu@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/","owner":"cpu","subject":"Revert 194394 \"Move swapcomplete callback into OutputSurface\"","created":"2013-04-16 22:05:37.453400","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2013-04-16 22:06:57.532060","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":14308015}
