The only other plugin included with Chromium is the \"vnd.npapi-test\" test plugin.\n\nThat plugin doesn't export any functions.  It runs a hard-coded test identified by an embed tag parameter and then calls back to Javascript.  This doesn't work for us because we end up with a race between the plugin's callback function and our test callback function on load.  There may be another way to check if the plugin has already loaded, but if so, I'm unaware of it.  It could also, of course, be modified to export a function.\n\nI may look into this later, but I don't think it's really an issue, since the ui_tests use it and there's been no effort to change that.","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-05-06 04:37:55.912821","approval":false}],"owner_email":"mmenke@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"mmenke","subject":"Add the TestNetscapePlugIn to the browser_test dependencies.","created":"2011-05-05 16:09:10.653290","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-05-24 13:06:56.564596","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":6927045}
