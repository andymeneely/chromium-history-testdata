You weren't on the earlier thread when we discussed it, but here's what I said:\n\nI talked about this briefly with Ben when I was in MTV last week.\nBasically, the \"sync-team recommended\" way to sync app order would be\nto add a string field to the app specifics proto representing the\norder, as well as some special logic to make sure that only O(1) app\nsync datas are modified whenever an app is moved, deleted, etc.\n\nAside from the code change itself, there may be bugs arising from a few sources:\n- Older clients should preserve this order field, even though it may\nnot recognize/respect it.\n- Newer clients would need to deal with data from older clients not\nhaving this field.\n- Some extensions/apps are not synced, so their ordering would have to\nfigured out.\n\n....\n\nThere's no need to involve floating point in this.  Just use\nlexicographic ordering of strings, appending a new digit to the string\nwhen necessary, and you're good.  The disadvantage is unbounded growth\nover time, but that seems like a pathological case, and can be\nmitigated by 'resetting' the strings.","draft":false,"lineno":29,"date":"2011-10-03 21:35:09.823622","left":false},{"author":"akalin","author_email":"akalin@chromium.org","text":"Please provide detailed comments about what exactly the app launch index represents.","draft":false,"lineno":29,"date":"2011-10-04 21:06:15.266624","left":false},{"author":"akalin","author_email":"akalin@chromium.org","text":"Also, please provide detailed comments about what the page index is.
