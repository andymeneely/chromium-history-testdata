{"description":"Revert 28558 because this is clearly responsible for\nbreaking the interactive ui tests. It just needs a clobber.\n\nIt looks like 2 parts of the code don't agree on the number of\nbuttons on the bookmark bar. Maybe because part of the code is\ncompiled with CHROME_PERSONALIZATION = 1 while the test is compiled\nwith CHROME_PERSONALIZATION = 0. Maybe this new gyp change broke the\ndefine propagation. This is really easy to replicate, and should also\nbe easy to debug.\n\nOriginal Log:\nRelanding the interactive UI tests GYP factor out, as it turns\nout it is not responsible for breaking the interactive ui tests.\n\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=28668","cc":["chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"reviewers":["jcampan@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"nsylvain@chromium.org","recipients":["nsylvain@chromium.org","jcampan@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-10-10 18:47:29.217063","approval":false}],"owner_email":"nsylvain@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://chrome-svn/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"Nicolas Sylvain","subject":"Revert 28558 because this is clearly responsible for...","created":"2009-10-10 18:47:24.541791","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-05-25 20:15:34.894076","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":271046}
