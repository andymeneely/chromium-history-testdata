Is there anything we can do?\n\nI filed NSS bug 753136 and described how to fix this:\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753136\n\nBasically we need to examine all the TLS hello extension\nhandlers called by ssl3_HandleHelloExtensions and the call\nsites of ssl3_HandleHelloExtensions:\n\nhttp://mxr.mozilla.org/security/ident?i=ssl3_HandleHelloExtensions\n\nFor the former, I think it is best done in a series of\n1-1.5 hour \"pair programming\" sessions.  Ekr, would you\nhave time to do that?","draft":false,"lineno":2010,"date":"2012-05-08 22:15:11.765739","left":false}],"id":32003,"is_binary":false},"net/third_party/nss/ssl/sslt.h":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":2,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":2,"num_removed":1,"messages":[],"id":32007,"is_binary":false},"net/third_party/nss/ssl/sslsock.c":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":2,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":71,"num_removed":0,"messages":[],"id":32006,"is_binary":false},"net/third_party/nss/ssl/sslimpl.h":{"status":"M    ","num_chunks":2,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":7,"num_removed":0,"messages":[],"id":32004,"is_binary":false}},"owner_email":"wtc@chromium.org","owner":"wtc","message":"Avoid goto","try_job_results":[],"created":"2012-05-04 00:42:45.856398","url":null,"num_comments":2,"modified":"2012-05-08 22:15:11.823130","patchset":31002,"issue":9982019}
