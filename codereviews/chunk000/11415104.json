{"description":"Add support for negative times for foreign sessions.\n\nIn the ForeignSessionsHandler we compare remote times to our local\nsystem time. This can lead to negative times, and as such we handle the\ncase correctly.\n\nThis CL uses a default-constructor base::TimeDelta() whenever this\nhappens, instead of passing in a negative time, which caused tests to\ncrash since they end up in a NOTREACHED() statement.\n\nBUG=154839\nTBR=estade@chromium.org\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=169365","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-ntp@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","yfriedman@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["zea@chromium.org","estade@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"nyquist@chromium.org","recipients":["nyquist@chromium.org","zea@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-ntp@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","yfriedman@chromium.org"],"text":"zea: PTAL","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-21 19:04:50.491190","approval":false},{"sender":"zea@chromium.org","recipients":["nyquist@chromium.org","zea@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-ntp@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","yfriedman@chromium.org"],"text":"LGTM","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-11-21 19:11:57.780190","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["nyquist@chromium.org","zea@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-ntp@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","yfriedman@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
