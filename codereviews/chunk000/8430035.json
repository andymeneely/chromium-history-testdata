{"description":"Polish the extension app notifications a bit:\n\n1) Add the handleCloseEvent setter so we can get rid of the bubble (munjal, can you take a look at this piece)?\n2) Get rid of error message when uninstalling apps.\n3) Make sure the bubble doesn't pop up in the top left corner while the icons for the apps are loading.\n\nBUG=88067, 102606\nTEST=When loading the NTP, notification bubbles should not flash briefly in the top left corner. The inspector should have no error message when removing (uninstalling apps) and bubbles you close should not come back.\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=109012","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","arv@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["arv@chromium.org","munjal@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"finnur@chromium.org","recipients":["finnur@chromium.org","arv@chromium.org","munjal@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","arv@chromium.org"],"text":"munjal, can you take a look at the closeHandler from a sync team perspective. \n\nErik, rest?\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/8430035/diff/1/chrome/browser/resources/shared/js/cr/ui/expandable_bubble.js\nFile chrome/browser/resources/shared/js/cr/ui/expandable_bubble.js (left):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/8430035/diff/1/chrome/browser/resources/shared/js/cr/ui/expandable_bubble.js#oldcode106\nchrome/browser/resources/shared/js/cr/ui/expandable_bubble.js:106: if (width > 0) {\nThis was a mistake on my part in the last CL, wasn't meant to be checked in.","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-11-03 15:58:40.601193","approval":false},{"sender":"finnur@chromium.org","recipients":["finnur@chromium.org","arv@chromium.org","munjal@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","arv@chromium.org"],"text":"Update failure is due to LKGR being behind, I believe.
