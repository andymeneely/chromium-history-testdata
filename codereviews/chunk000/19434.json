{"description":"Fixes crash in adding a menu item. As far as I can tell\nl10n_util::GetString(IDS_TASK_MANAGER) is returning \"\". Tony, myself\nand Rahul don't think this should be possible, yet we have crashes\nindicating otherwise. If IDS_TASK_MANAGER returns an emtpy string then\nmenu derefs NULL and we crash.\n\nBUG=6206\nTEST=no way to directly test this, instead just make sure menus still\n     work.\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=8829","cc":["chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"reviewers":["ben@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"sky@chromium.org","recipients":["sky@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-01-28 19:33:11.659825","approval":false},{"sender":"ben@chromium.org","recipients":["sky@chromium.org","ben@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"ok","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-01-28 19:34:52.878179","approval":false}],"owner_email":"sky@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://chrome-svn/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"sky","subject":"Fixes crash in adding a menu item.
