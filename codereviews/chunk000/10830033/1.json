(http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromiumos/platform/cryptohome.git;a=blob;f=service.cc;h=e27e2f087da4e96c315a49b052dea1f0d2e146a6;hb=refs/heads/master#l954)\nThis method is named badly from the beginning, I think it should be renamed to something like MyabeStartInitializeTpm().\nAnyway, I'm using the name \"TpmCanAttemptOwnership\" because the Cryptohome service is providing the method with this name.\nIf we are going to rename this method, we should also rename Cryptohome service's method name too.","draft":false,"lineno":129,"date":"2012-07-27 04:37:18.879460","left":false},{"author":"stevenjb","author_email":"stevenjb@chromium.org","text":"OK, I see.
