This is the same function the other tests use, and I exit due to the same call to MessageLoop::Quit.\n\nThe only difference is I need to renavigate the prerendered TabContents, as opposed to the visible tab contents, to generate the crash.  I need the redirect here because I can't do the renavigation from HTML files because of security checks, or prerender about:crash directly.","draft":false,"lineno":1040,"date":"2011-06-17 16:30:15.002763","left":false},{"author":"Pawe\u0142 Hajdan Jr.","author_email":"phajdan.jr@chromium.org","text":"This is a test.
