{"description":"Makes TaskManagerModel cache all values (values are fetched on\ndemand). Without this the UI could ask for the same value twice in a\nrow and get different values, even though the UI was not told the\nvalue changed. This can cause all sorts of problems, in particular if\nsorting is enabled it can lead to crashes (std::sort isn't too happy\nif values change out from underneath it).\n\nBUG=none\nTEST=none\nR=yoshiki@chromium.org\n\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=177001","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","yoshiki+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["yoshiki@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"sky@chromium.org","recipients":["sky@chromium.org","yoshiki@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","yoshiki+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-14 04:58:04.814430","approval":false},{"sender":"yoshiki@chromium.org","recipients":["sky@chromium.org","yoshiki@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","yoshiki+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm with nit.\n\nhttps://codereview.chromium.org/11877012/diff/13003/chrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc\nFile chrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc (right):\n\nhttps://codereview.chromium.org/11877012/diff/13003/chrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc#newcode625\nchrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc:625: int index) const {\nnit: This method is completely same as TaskManagerModel::GetProcess(), hence we can remove this.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-15 08:21:38.758500","approval":true},{"sender":"sky@chromium.org","recipients":["sky@chromium.org","yoshiki@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","yoshiki+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"https://codereview.chromium.org/11877012/diff/13003/chrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc\nFile chrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc (right):\n\nhttps://codereview.chromium.org/11877012/diff/13003/chrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc#newcode625\nchrome/browser/task_manager/task_manager.cc:625: int index) const {\nOn 2013/01/15 08:21:38, yoshiki wrote:\n> nit: This method is completely same as TaskManagerModel::GetProcess(), hence we\n> can remove this.\n\nDone.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-01-15 16:21:25.313490","approval":false},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["sky@chromium.org","yoshiki@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","yoshiki+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
