I was anticipating needing to subclass in order to do some custom drawing, but now that I think about it, I will likely only need to subclass NSPopUpButtonCell.\n\nI'll pull this into a function for now.","draft":false,"lineno":68,"date":"2012-07-09 21:19:20.450270","left":false},{"author":"Patrick Dubroy","author_email":"dubroy@chromium.org","text":"On 2012/07/09 18:58:02, rsesek wrote:\n> The convention on OS X is to horizontally align on the right edge of the label,\n> s.t. the raggedy edges are left/right instead of center/right.
