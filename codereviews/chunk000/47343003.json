{"description":"Changed the user log in selection while the log in screen is shown\n\nSo - after talking with designers here is how it should be: Show only the one user which is active and don't show the \"add user button\" upon click. Furthermore show all users in the system tray but do not make them clickable.\n\nBUG=313036\nTEST=visual (multi profile mode, add one and two users and checked appearance as well as UX)\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=231993","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","kalyan.kondapally@intel.com","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+ash@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["jennyz@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"skuhne@chromium.org","recipients":["skuhne@chromium.org","jennyz@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","kalyan.kondapally@intel.com","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+ash@chromium.org"],"text":"Please have a look!","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-10-30 19:44:07.871810","approval":false},{"sender":"jennyz@chromium.org","recipients":["skuhne@chromium.org","jennyz@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","kalyan.kondapally@intel.com","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+ash@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-10-30 20:16:46.125930","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["skuhne@chromium.org","jennyz@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","kalyan.kondapally@intel.com","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+ash@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
