Until this proliferates, I think it's simpler to just keep them as they are.\n\nThe other similar checks, such as the ones in Update(), are conceptually different. They are not checking whether instant_tab_ or loader_ match the caller's contents; rather that the instant_tab_ contents match the active tab contents.
