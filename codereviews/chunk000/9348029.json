{"description":"Make inline c blocks non-greedy, and use to add pragma pack to gamepad structure\r\n\r\nChange the regex to non-greedy so that an idl file can have >1 \"#inline c\" blocks.\r\n\r\nUse that to bracket gamepad shared memory structure so that packing matches regardless of compiler settings/bitsize. This part is a temporary fix. The shared memory structure shouldn't be exposed in idl eventually anyway.\r\n\r\nBUG=113087\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=121000","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","piman+watch@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yzshen+watch@chromium.org","ihf+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["noelallen@google.com","brettw@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"scottmg@chromium.org","recipients":["scottmg@chromium.org","noelallen@google.com","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","piman+watch@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yzshen+watch@chromium.org","ihf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-02-07 21:24:11.858722","approval":false},{"sender":"scottmg@chromium.org","recipients":["scottmg@chromium.org","noelallen@google.com","brettw@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","piman+watch@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yzshen+watch@chromium.org","ihf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"+brettw for OWNERS of webkit/plugins/ppapi/ppapi_plugin_instance.cc\n\nThe static_assert needs to be disabled until WebKit patch lands + rolls from here: http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78022","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-02-07 21:46:08.877077","approval":false},{"sender":"scottmg@chromium.org","recipients":["scottmg@chromium.org","noelallen@google.com","brettw@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","piman+watch@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yzshen+watch@chromium.org","ihf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"On 2012/02/07 21:46:08, scottmg wrote:\n\nWebKit side is ready, but this side has to go first: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78022","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-02-08 00:57:09.411355","approval":false},{"sender":"brettw@chromium.org","recipients":["scottmg@chromium.org","noelallen@google.com","brettw@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","piman+watch@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","yzshen+watch@chromium.org","ihf+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-02-08 05:18:49.399874","approval":true}],"owner_email":"scottmg@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"http://git.chromium.org/chromium/src.git@master","owner":"scottmg","subject":"Make inline c blocks non-greedy, and use to add pragma pack to gamepad structure","created":"2012-02-07 21:20:56.750196","patchsets":[1,3001],"modified":"2012-02-08 18:27:37.951496","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":9348029}
