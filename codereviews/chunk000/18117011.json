There's nothing in there to focus except buttons, and a search box. Since enter shouldn't go to the default button in any of those cases it makes more sense to not have a default button in my opinion. There's always escape to get out of the overview anyway.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-06-28 00:30:56.977860","approval":false},{"sender":"dbeam@chromium.org","recipients":["rfevang@chromium.org","dbeam@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-options@chromium.org","arv+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"so an enter while in the search box and an enter on an X (to delete an entry) will still work?","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-06-28 00:42:52.095490","approval":false},{"sender":"rfevang@chromium.org","recipients":["rfevang@chromium.org","dbeam@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-options@chromium.org","arv+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"On 2013/06/28 00:42:52, Dan Beam wrote:\n> so an enter while in the search box and an enter on an X (to delete an entry)\n> will still work?\n\nHitting enter in the search box does nothing (it updates the rest of the view on change). Enter on the X or on the show button activates the buttons as expected, both before and after this CL.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-06-28 00:55:55.766990","approval":false},{"sender":"dbeam@chromium.org","recipients":["rfevang@chromium.org","dbeam@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-options@chromium.org","arv+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"great, thanks for the explanations, lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-06-28 01:06:52.487540","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["rfevang@chromium.org","dbeam@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","dbeam+watch-options@chromium.org","arv+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
