{"description":"Revert 93480 - Initial sensor event provider for testing views screen rotation\n\nThe sensors API will unify various types of sensor data into a set of channels, each of which provides change events and periodic updates.\n\nThis version of the API is intended only to support the experimental screen rotation code and is not for general use. In particular, the final listener will declare generic |OnSensorChange| and |OnSensorUpdate| methods, rather than the special-purpose |OnScreenOrientationChange|.\n\nBUG=none\nTEST=manual with http://codereview.chromium.org/7273073/\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=93094\n\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/7366011\n\nTBR=cwolfe@chromium.org\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=93491","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["cwolfe@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"dmichael@chromium.org","recipients":["dmichael@chromium.org","cwolfe@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-07-21 22:30:13.772737","approval":false}],"owner_email":"dmichael@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"dmichael","subject":"Revert 93480 - Initial sensor event provider for testing views screen rotation","created":"2011-07-21 22:30:11.790294","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-07-21 22:30:53.227086","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":7479010}
