I guess returning false always is a good way to test that the readback and forced draw still occur even if we return false though.  I will change all of the tests to return false like they did before this patch.","draft":false,"lineno":606,"date":"2013-09-09 22:34:21.086060","left":false}],"id":9001,"is_binary":false}},"owner_email":"brianderson@chromium.org","owner":"Brian Anderson","message":"fix usage of did_react_to_first_commit_","try_job_results":[],"created":"2013-09-09 21:32:24.239530","url":null,"num_comments":13,"modified":"2013-09-09 22:34:21.210600","patchset":8001,"issue":23542014}
