My concern was that the caller needs to know a lot more than desired and it might lead to duplicate code.","draft":false,"lineno":83,"date":"2012-06-18 16:37:51.924990","left":false}],"id":6002,"is_binary":false}},"owner_email":"serya@chromium.org","owner":"SeRya","message":"Comments addressed.","try_job_results":[],"created":"2012-05-29 15:26:19.484348","url":null,"num_comments":21,"modified":"2012-06-18 16:37:51.958003","patchset":7001,"issue":10459007}
