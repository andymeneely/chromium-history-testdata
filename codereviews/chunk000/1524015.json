{"description":"Speculative fix for a ChromeFrame crash reported on the crash server. The crash occurs when the ChromeFrame active document instance is torn\ndown. This takes down the automation client instance which handles communication with Chrome. When the automation client instance is torn\ndown it tries to stop pending chrome requests which causes a crash because of an invalid url fetcher object. This could only happen if the\nurl fetcher object belongs to a deleted active document instance, which could occur if the automation client instance was reused during a\nReinitialize operation which failed.\n\nFix is to tear down the pending url requests at the top of the Reinitialize function before checking for failure cases.\n\nShould fix bug http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=40590\n\nBug=40590\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=43797","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","amit@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["stoyan@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"ananta@chromium.org","recipients":["ananta@chromium.org","stoyan@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","amit@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2010-04-06 22:05:10.937351","approval":false},{"sender":"stoyan@chromium.org","recipients":["ananta@chromium.org","stoyan@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","amit@chromium.org"],"text":"LGtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2010-04-06 22:07:46.630137","approval":true}],"owner_email":"ananta@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://chrome-svn/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"ananta","subject":"Speculative fix for a ChromeFrame crash reported on the crash server.
