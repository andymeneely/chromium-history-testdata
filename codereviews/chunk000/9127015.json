What about renaming browser_frame_view_chromeos.h/cc to compact_browser_frame_view.h/cc, moving it into chrome/browser/ui/views/frame, and using it for ChromeOS Aura, ChromeOS non-Aura, and Win Aura?

Good idea!","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-01-07 04:43:06.507074","approval":false},{"sender":"xiyuan@chromium.org","recipients":["xiyuan@chromium.org","jamescook@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sky@chromium.org"],"text":"On 2012/01/07 04:42:02, James Cook (Chromium) wrote:\n> On 2012/01/07 00:51:39, xiyuan wrote:\n> > Should I change gyp to include BrowserFrameViewChromeos files for aura build\n> to\n> > get rid of \"#if defined(OS_CHROMEOS)\"?\n> \n> I think we're trying to keep win_aura and linux_chromeos_aura behaving similarly\n> as much as possible.

And compact_browser_frame_view sounds like a good name to me.","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-01-07 05:08:07.274915","approval":false},{"sender":"jamescook@chromium.org","recipients":["xiyuan@chromium.org","jamescook@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sky@chromium.org"],"text":"OK.  I don't care much about the #ifdef OS_CHROME (it's nice to eliminate, but it doesn't really bother me).  I just don't like the idea of win_aura having to include files from chromeos/ directories, which is why I suggested the rename.
