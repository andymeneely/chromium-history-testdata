{"description":"Removes the space for notification icon if it's not visible (2nd)\n\nGridLayout will make the space for a child even if the child is\nnot visible, which makes an extra space between status area and\npanels when there are no notifications.\n\nTo remove this space, this CL makes StatusAreaWidgetDelegate catch\nchild's visibility change, and do not count invisible children in\nits GridLayout.\n\nThe previous CL was reverted due to test break on win_aura. This\nCL includes its fix.\n\nBUG=238770\nTBR=stevenjb@chromium.org\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=199451","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["stevenjb@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"mukai@chromium.org","recipients":["mukai@chromium.org","stevenjb@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"the previous one was reverted due to a test failure on win8_aura.
