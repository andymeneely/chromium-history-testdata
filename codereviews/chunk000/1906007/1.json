How about:\n\nA page can't spawn popups (or do anything else, either) until its load commits, so when we reach here, the popup was spawned by the NavigationController's last committed entry, not the active entry.  For example, if a page opens a popup in an onunload() handler, then the active entry is the page to be loaded as we navigate away from the unloading page.  For this reason, we can't use GetURL() to get the opener URL, because it returns the active entry.","draft":false,"lineno":1432,"date":"2010-05-05 19:45:21.861087","left":false}],"id":2,"is_binary":false}},"owner_email":"erg@chromium.org","owner":"Elliot Glaysher","message":null,"try_job_results":[{"parent_name":null,"tests":[],"slave":null,"url":"http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-server/buildstatus?builder=linux&number=29035","timestamp":"2010-05-05 20:06:48.729800","builder":"linux","clobber":null,"project":null,"reason":null,"result":"0","key":"ahdzfmNocm9taXVtY29kZXJldmlldy1ocnIuCxIFSXNzdWUY16p0DAsSCFBhdGNoU2V0GAEMCxIMVHJ5Sm9iUmVzdWx0GIknDA","requester":null,"buildnumber":null,"revision":null},{"parent_name":null,"tests":[],"slave":null,"url":"http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/try-server/buildstatus?builder=mac&number=29060","timestamp":"2010-05-05 20:06:48.729800","builder":"mac","clobber":null,"project":null,"reason":null,"result":"0","key":"ahdzfmNocm9taXVtY29kZXJldmlldy1ocnIuCxIFSXNzdWUY16p0DAsSCFBhdGNoU2V0GAEMCxIMVHJ5Sm9iUmVzdWx0GIonDA","requester":null,"buildnumber":null,"revision":null}],"created":"2010-05-05 19:12:07.544649","url":null,"num_comments":1,"modified":"2012-01-13 14:34:27.492596","patchset":1,"issue":1906007}
