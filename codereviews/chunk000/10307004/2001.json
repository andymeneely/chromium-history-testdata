But for others types like email, element.value() returns the sanitized value and editingValue() will return the raw visible value.\n\nFor example, if you type in \"a@a.com, b\" (separated with comma and space)\nelement.value() returns \"a@a.com,b\" without the extra space\nelement.selectionEnd() returns the position with the extra space\n\nso you can't use element.value().length() and element.selectionEnd() to tell if the caret is at the end or not.\n","draft":false,"lineno":64,"date":"2012-05-09 01:38:21.997964","left":false},{"author":"keishi1","author_email":"keishi@chromium.org","text":"On 2012/05/07 23:34:52, Ilya Sherman wrote:\n> nit: This line should be indented one more space.

What is the motivation for not wanting to expose it, and instead making clients jump through hoops for this sort of functionality?","draft":false,"lineno":629,"date":"2012-05-09 02:38:58.503558","left":false}],"id":3001,"is_binary":false},"chrome/renderer/autofill/autofill_agent.h":{"status":"M","num_chunks":1,"no_base_file":false,"property_changes":"","num_added":2,"num_removed":0,"messages":[],"id":3002,"is_binary":false}},"owner_email":"keishi@chromium.org","owner":"keishi1","message":"Updated","try_job_results":[],"created":"2012-05-07 03:56:07.846874","url":null,"num_comments":11,"modified":"2012-05-09 02:38:58.557693","patchset":2001,"issue":10307004}
