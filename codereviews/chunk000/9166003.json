{"description":"Fix performance.timing.navigationStart on cross-renderer navigation.\n\nAccording to the Navigation Timing spec, this value should be right after\nbeforeunload fires on the previous document. On cross-renderer navigations,\nwe were instead using the no-previous-document code path. The result is that\nnavigationStart is 80 - 500 ms earlier and lines up better with other load\ntime metrics.\n\nI have a test case in mind that should be pretty reliable, but it will no\nlonger work once we update to make navigationStart 0 and base all other times\nfrom that. Given that, I'm not sure it's worth writing the test, only to have\nit removed in the next test. My idea was to have one tab initiate the navigation\nin another tab, then record the time. navigationStart should be < the recorded\ntime. If you have any other ideas how to test this, please let me know.\n\nSee also: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75922\n\nBUG=104788\nTEST=Added printfs.\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=125035\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=125467","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","avi@chromium.org","creis+watch@chromium.org","ajwong+watch@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","dpranke-watch+content@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","brettw-cc@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["tonyg@chromium.org","darin@chromium.org","creis@chromium.org","avi@chromium.org","joi@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"simonjam@chromium.org","recipients":["simonjam@chromium.org","tonyg@chromium.org","darin@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","avi@chromium.org","creis+watch@chromium.org","ajwong+watch@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","dpranke-watch+content@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","brettw-cc@chromium.org"],"text":"Tony, please review for correctness with the spec.\n\nDarin, this is the other half of the WebKit API change.

The spec doesn't go into this level of detail. Basically, the spec says:\n- If there was a previous document, navigationStart should be immediately after beforeunload.\n- Otherwise, navigationStart should be immediately before the resource is requested.\n\nMy vote is that we go with the latter in this situation. beforeunload may complete way after the new document is done loading.
