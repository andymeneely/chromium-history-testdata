{"description":"Add descriptive text for omnibox popup result items.\n\nFixes a couple of bugs in painting and updating:\n- properly size the canvas we draw the child views into so the bottom pixel doesn't bleed\n- properly schedule repaints when the presentation changes for the same number of results so that we repaint selection changes.\n\nBack to using system colors. Adds highlight icons.\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=14826\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=14873","cc":["chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"reviewers":["pkasting@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"ben@chromium.org","recipients":["ben@chromium.org","pkasting@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-04-27 23:45:33.502933","approval":false},{"sender":"pkasting@chromium.org","recipients":["ben@chromium.org","pkasting@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"http://codereview.chromium.org/99102/diff/1/2\nFile chrome/app/generated_resources.grd (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.chromium.org/99102/diff/1/2#newcode203\nLine 203: <message name=\"IDS_AUTOCOMPLETE_MATCH_DESCRIPTION_SEPARTOR\" desc=\"The separator between a result in the autocomplete popup and its description.\">\nCan't do this, for i18n reasons.

I was hoping to defer this until all of the rest of the presentation was in place, and then have the provider supply the \" - \" as well and classify it at the same time its classifying everything else, because its hard to modify the classifications in this code because of how everything is const :-P Once the modifications to the provider have been made, I would just remove this code from here.","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-04-28 19:55:27.191305","approval":false},{"sender":"pkasting@chromium.org","recipients":["ben@chromium.org","pkasting@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com"],"text":"LGTM as-is, feel free to have me do the i18n changes if you want","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-04-28 21:34:42.545746","approval":true}],"owner_email":"ben@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://chrome-svn/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"Ben Goodger (Google)","subject":"Add descriptive text for omnibox popup result items....","created":"2009-04-27 23:44:06.619833","patchsets":[1,7,9,1018],"modified":"2011-06-16 13:41:43.213578","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":99102}
