{"description":"Revert 54643 - Fix --kiosk to work regardless of the startup pref setting or supplied URLs. \n\nThis also fixes a bug in Linux Views where calling BrowserWindow::Show() wouldn't synchronously call BrowserList::SetLastActive().  This happens naturally in Windows and was already explicitly done in BrowserWindowGtk and BrowserWindowCocoas, but missing it for Linux Views resulted in crashes when the kiosk code tried to get the last active window before the message loop had pumped the async activation change message.\n\nBUG=none \nTEST=Set Chrome to \"open windows and tabs from last time\", then run with --kiosk. Should start in kiosk mode (fullscreen, no status bubble).\nReview URL: http://codereview.chromium.org/2847090\n\nTBR=pkasting@chromium.org\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=54691","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","ben+cc@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["pkasting@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"pkasting@chromium.org","recipients":["pkasting@chromium.org","pkasting@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","ben+cc@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2010-08-03 02:13:50.614042","approval":false}],"owner_email":"pkasting@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"Peter Kasting","subject":"Revert 54643 - Fix --kiosk to work regardless of the startup pref setting or ...","created":"2010-08-03 02:13:46.956161","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-05-20 02:30:45.414176","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":3017052}
