{"description":"setCookie shouldn't convert WebString to 16 bits\n\nPreviously, setCookie forced WebString to have a 16 bit backing buffer by\ncalling WebString::data() in the common case, that means we'd create and retain\na 16 bit version of the string in addition to the 8 bit version. We're working\nto remove WebString::data() from the API because it's a memory footgun.\n\nIn profiling Mobile Gmail, this line of code triggered 50% of the remaining 16\nbit upconversions (after my other in-flight changes land).\n\nR=jamesr\nNOTRY=true\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=202257","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["jamesr@chromium.org","commit-bot@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"abarth@chromium.org","recipients":["abarth@chromium.org","jamesr@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-05-24 21:10:15.334010","approval":false},{"sender":"jamesr@chromium.org","recipients":["abarth@chromium.org","jamesr@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"lgtm","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-05-24 21:41:37.134130","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["abarth@chromium.org","jamesr@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
