{"description":"Don't call AcceptCurrentInstantPreview() when the user hits Tab.\n\nThis call is meant to commit the Instant overlay (preview). However, the overlay\nnever shows if the omnibox dropdown is not open. So, either the Tab is handled\nby the omnibox edit (to enter keyword mode or to move down the list of dropdown\nsuggestions) or there's no overlay to commit. I.e., this call never succeeds.\n\nSo, it's entirely useless and can be removed.\n\nRemoving it does help fix a bug, though. In extended mode, Instant could be\ntalking to the active tab instead of an overlay, with the dropdown closed. Here,\ncalling AcceptCurrentInstantPreview() when the user hits Tab leads to\nInstantController::CommitIfPossible(INSTANT_COMMIT_PRESSED_ENTER), so Instant\nwrongly thinks the user hit Enter and calls \"Submit(query)\" on the active tab.\n\nThe bug only occurs on non-Aura Windows, because in Aura, Tab doesn't cause\nAcceptCurrentInstantPreview() to be called anyway. So, I've just removed this\ncall altogether, from GTK and Win too.\n\nBUG=179974\nR=pkasting@chromium.org\nTEST=See bug.\n\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=188281","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","suzhe@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["pkasting@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"sreeram@chromium.org","recipients":["sreeram@chromium.org","pkasting@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","suzhe@chromium.org"],"text":"Please review.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-03-14 22:08:59.018340","approval":false},{"sender":"pkasting@chromium.org","recipients":["sreeram@chromium.org","pkasting@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","suzhe@chromium.org"],"text":"LGTM","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-03-15 01:33:36.575170","approval":true},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["sreeram@chromium.org","pkasting@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org","suzhe@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
