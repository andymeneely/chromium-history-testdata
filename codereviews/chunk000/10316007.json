{"description":"Make the Geoposition helper struct public\r\n\r\nThis CL moves the Geoposition struct from content/common to public/content/common.h so that it can be shared by content and browser. The struct is placed in the |content| namespace and as required by the style guide, all methods except the constructor and Validate() are removed.\r\nThis paves the way for a follow-up CL in which the content will provide geolocation information to the browser.\r\n\r\nBUG=chromium-os:18710\r\nTEST=Chrome and tests build, run\r\n\r\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=134989","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["jam@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"bartfab@chromium.org","recipients":["bartfab@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","joi+watch-content@chromium.org","darin-cc@chromium.org","jam@chromium.org"],"text":"Hi John,\n\nAs discussed, I broke my changes into several CLs.
