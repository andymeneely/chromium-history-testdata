{"description":"Revert 152221 - chromeos: Sync animation.\nThis was causing Linux ChromiumOS (dbg) browser_tests to fail with timeouts on several tests, identified with a local bisect.\n\n- Pulse app list button while LauncherModel has STATUS_LOADING;\n- Remove LauncherItemStatus::STATUS_IS_PENDING etc since it is no longer needed;\n- ChromeLauncherController sets LauncherModel::STATUS_LOADING on starting and\n  watch for sync finish and pending extension install. It sets\n  LauncherModel::STATUS_NORMAL when sync is finished and there is no pending\n  extension install from sync, or when a maximum 60 seconds timeout since\n  turning on loading status;\n\nBUG=129236\nTEST=Verify sync animation after OOBE.\n\nReview URL: https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10829268\n\nTBR=xiyuan@chromium.org\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=152352","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","mihaip-chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["xiyuan@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"flackr@chromium.org","recipients":["flackr@chromium.org","xiyuan@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","mihaip-chromium-reviews@chromium.org","sadrul@chromium.org","ben+watch@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-08-20 17:33:55.109450","approval":false}],"owner_email":"flackr@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"flackr","subject":"Revert 152221 - chromeos: Sync animation.","created":"2012-08-20 17:33:45.415870","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2012-08-20 17:34:19.797700","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":10827420}
