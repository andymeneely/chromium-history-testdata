If the roll\nhas failed or timed out (1 day, 0:00:00 hours) it will close the issue and start a new one.\n\nGardeners should not have to think about the auto-roll bot.  They should feel free to\nclose the CL's it generates, land other rolls manually (it will notice a post a new roll), or ignore\nrolling entirely!  You won't break the bot.  It shouldn't break you (or the tree).\nIf you have any trouble please email eseidel@chromium.org.\n\nIf for some reason the roll-bot is causing trouble anyone can stop it by using\nthe word \"STOP\" (in all caps) in a comment on this issue.  The roll-bot can\nlater be resumed by closing the issue.","disapproval":false,"date":"2013-05-27 07:24:23.477530","approval":false},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["eseidel@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","jchaffraix@chromium.org","tomhudson@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
