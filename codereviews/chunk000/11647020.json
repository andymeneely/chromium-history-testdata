{"description":"Immersive mode drawing and triggering improvements\n\n* Don't draw the colored bars for favicons. This makes the bar less visually\n  noisy.\n* Lighten the bars slightly because they are much smaller areas than the tabs;\n  this makes them visually match better.\n* Only trigger reveal when the mouse stops moving, which matches the Ash\n  auto-hidden launcher behavior and feels more natural.\n\nBUG=166926,166927\nTEST=manual\n\n\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=174072","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["sky@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"jamescook@chromium.org","recipients":["jamescook@chromium.org","sky@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","tfarina@chromium.org"],"text":"Sky, PTAL.
