{"description":"This CL adds a histogram as part of the improved SafeBrowsing download protection to measure how frequently certain file extensions appear in downloads.  In particular, we're interested in measuring how often users download files whose extension might be malicious (e.g., and exe file for example).\n\nBUG=None\nTEST=download an exe file and visit about:histograms. Verify that \"SBClientDownload.DownloadExtensions\" has been incremented.\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=108313","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","moheeb@google.com"],"reviewers":["mattm@chromium.org","bryner@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"noelutz@google.com","recipients":["noelutz@google.com","mattm@chromium.org","bryner@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","moheeb@google.com"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-11-01 22:29:46.738487","approval":false},{"sender":"mattm@chromium.org","recipients":["noelutz@google.com","mattm@chromium.org","bryner@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","moheeb@google.com"],"text":"lgtm wit nits:\nupdate description to mention safebrowsing download protection.\nTEST -> you can load about:histograms after downloading some stuff\n\nalso should add this enum to the histograms.xml in a separate CL","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-11-02 00:00:06.272463","approval":true},{"sender":"noelutz@google.com","recipients":["noelutz@google.com","mattm@chromium.org","bryner@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","moheeb@google.com"],"text":"On 2011/11/02 00:00:06, mattm wrote:\n> lgtm wit nits:\n> update description to mention safebrowsing download protection.\n> TEST -> you can load about:histograms after downloading some stuff\n> \n> also should add this enum to the histograms.xml in a separate CL\n\nupdated the comment, TEST and tested the histogram.\n\nThanks,\nnoe.","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-11-02 00:44:01.890709","approval":false},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["noelutz@google.com","mattm@chromium.org","bryner@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","moheeb@google.com"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
