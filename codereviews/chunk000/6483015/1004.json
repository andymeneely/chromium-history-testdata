Why?\n\nI think sky's point is that std::make_pair is implicitly specialising, and making a pair<char*,char*> which is getting cast to a pair<string, string>, which ends up calling the cast piecewise making the new pair.   switches::kFlagSwitchesBegin is a char* too, so presumably we'd want to wrap that in std::string() too, otherwise we're just doing it by halves.\n\nAlternatively and equivalently, I think I'll just explicitly instantiate make_pair with <std::string, std::string>, which avoids the cast of a pair, instead just doing casts of the arguments as they go in.  Does that make sense?  And sure, move to std::string() to construct the empty string.\n\nI just spoke about this with sky, and we agreed, I'll do this everywhere he pointed this out in the next upload.","draft":false,"lineno":555,"date":"2011-02-10 18:29:07.166151","left":false},{"author":"gavinp","author_email":"gavinp@chromium.org","text":"On 2011/02/10 16:10:07, cbentzel wrote:\n> Should this check that switch_and_value_pair.first is not already in\n> flags_switches_?
