That should also allow expansion of the types in this histogram for different session types.  Chris suggested we'd want this if we don't use the UMA field trial mechanism, and there might well be other reasons.\n\n","draft":false,"lineno":1586,"date":"2011-01-24 06:01:46.746384","left":false}],"id":2,"is_binary":false}},"owner_email":"gavinp@chromium.org","owner":"gavinp","message":null,"try_job_results":[],"created":"2011-01-23 00:05:15.739266","url":null,"num_comments":4,"modified":"2011-01-24 06:01:47.026000","patchset":1,"issue":6340013}
