But I'm worried that it would be non obvious to future users of DragWrapper that doDragOver would be called on enter as well. Of course the need to call doDragOver manually is probably not obvious either.","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-09-20 18:39:36.706028","approval":false},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["estade@chromium.org","csilv@chromium.org","dbeam@chromium.org","commit-bot@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","estade+watch@chromium.org","arv@chromium.org"],"text":"Change committed as 102016","disapproval":false,"date":"2011-09-20 20:58:40.141656","approval":false}],"owner_email":"estade@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src","owner":"Evan Stade","subject":"ntp4: dragging onto page switcher fix","created":"2011-09-19 21:02:51.523524","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-09-20 20:58:40.228627","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":7959001}
