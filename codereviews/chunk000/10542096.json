Basically, you just need to git fetch origin, git rebase origin/master [your branch], and git cl upload again.  It'll show a conflict in AUTHORS, just keep both versions.\n\nOtherwise I can land it as a new CL.","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-06-12 19:17:38.381013","approval":false},{"sender":"paivanof@gmail.com","recipients":["paivanof@gmail.com","shess@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"> Sigh.  git cl upload tells me that I'm not the owner.

I'd just leave it.  Duplication won't hurt anyone.\n\nThanks,\nscott","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-06-12 19:27:46.373698","approval":false},{"sender":"paivanof@gmail.com","recipients":["paivanof@gmail.com","shess@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"I've rebased.","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-06-13 00:43:15.277700","approval":false},{"sender":"commit-bot@chromium.org","recipients":["paivanof@gmail.com","shess@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org"],"text":"CQ is trying da patch.
