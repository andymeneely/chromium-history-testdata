{"description":"Revert 135175 - Revert 135164 - Cleanup of browser_test harness.\n\n-share the browser startup code with chrome. Apart from the benefit of making browser_tests more like Chrome, this allows us to write browser_tests that test app mode etc.\n-get rid of InProcessBrowserTest::set_initial_window_required now that the above is done\n-get rid of InProcessBrowserTest::set_show_window which didn't do anything\n-get rid of --disable-tab-closeable-state-watcher which was set by a chromeos test but not used anywhere\n\nI had to create the Mac autorelease pool object a little earlier, since it must be created before the first Browser window is created (which used to happen in InProcessBrowserTest::RunTestOnMainThreadLoop but now happens in BrowserTestBase::SetUp()).\nReview URL: https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10278003\n\nTBR=jam@chromium.org\nReview URL: https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10352015\n\nTBR=mmenke@chromium.org\nCommitted: https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=135194","cc":["chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nick@chromium.org","mihaip-chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nkostylev+watch@chromium.org","dhollowa+watch@chromium.org","stevenjb+watch@chromium.org","kkania@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","robertshield@chromium.org","tim@chromium.org","dyu@chromium.org","rsimha@chromium.org","isherman@chromium.org","davemoore+watch@chromium.org","akalin@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["mmenke@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"jam@chromium.org","recipients":["jam@chromium.org","mmenke@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nick@chromium.org","mihaip-chromium-reviews@chromium.org","nkostylev+watch@chromium.org","dhollowa+watch@chromium.org","stevenjb+watch@chromium.org","kkania@chromium.org","aa@chromium.org","robertshield@chromium.org","tim@chromium.org","dyu@chromium.org","rsimha@chromium.org","isherman@chromium.org","davemoore+watch@chromium.org","akalin@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2012-05-03 20:00:03.204955","approval":false}],"owner_email":"jam@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"jam","subject":"Revert 135175 - Revert 135164 - Cleanup of browser_test harness.","created":"2012-05-03 19:59:29.230442","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2012-05-03 20:00:18.743109","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":10349014}
