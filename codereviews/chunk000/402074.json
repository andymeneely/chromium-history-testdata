{"description":"Remove the utility process unit tests to simplify the utility process code a little (helpeful to make it use ChildProcessLauncher).  Note that the test isn't needed anymore as a unit test because since it was written, there have been a couple of tests that exercise this code path through browser_tests.  They use sandboxed utility processes so it's more equivalent to what the user experiences.\n\n\nCommitted: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=32446","cc":["chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com","ben+cc@chromium.org","phajdan.jr@chromium.org"],"reviewers":["tony@chromium.org"],"messages":[{"sender":"jam@chromium.org","recipients":["jam@chromium.org","tony@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com","ben+cc@chromium.org","phajdan.jr@chromium.org"],"text":"","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-11-19 00:18:55.266647","approval":false},{"sender":"tony@chromium.org","recipients":["jam@chromium.org","tony@chromium.org","chromium-reviews@googlegroups.com","ben+cc@chromium.org","phajdan.jr@chromium.org"],"text":"LGTM","disapproval":false,"date":"2009-11-19 00:24:16.949825","approval":true}],"owner_email":"jam@chromium.org","private":false,"base_url":"svn://chrome-svn/chrome/trunk/src/","owner":"jam","subject":"Remove the utility process unit tests to simplify the utility process code a ...","created":"2009-11-19 00:18:41.328122","patchsets":[1],"modified":"2011-05-28 03:25:42.265981","closed":true,"commit":false,"issue":402074}
